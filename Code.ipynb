Earlier, it was calculated that the number total number of 'likes' is 633412855 and the total number of tweets is 43074. Over the course of 12 years, which is 144 months, Elon Musk is tweeting, on average, 300 times a month. He garners about 4.4 million likes per month, meaning this is the number of updates to the like counter every month. Assuming an integer is stored as a 4 byte value for each Tweet. This means there is 1200 bytes just for the 'like' variables. The update is occurring frequently, at about 100 likes per minute, and this data is shown to all users and accessed by about 2400 users every minute, assuming an engagement rate of 0.05 so displaying the updated like count to every user means around 400 million bytes, or 400 MB, is accessed and touched just for showing the like count to users on a monthly basis. So while the like counter isn't a large amount of data, just incrementing and storing the integers has a tremendous effect on how much users will interact with and access. ","metadata":{}}]}
