My code can be found as a .js file titled 'HW2.js'

Additionally, I made a few more changes to each VM instance:
  1. cd into /etc/mysql
  2. nano mariadb.cnf
  3. Append the following lines:
    [mysqld]
    skip-networking=0
    skip-bind-address

And for the project on GCP, I added a firewall rule as follows:
  {
    "allowed": [
      {
        "IPProtocol": "all"
      }
    ],
    "creationTimestamp": "2022-02-22T09:51:43.312-08:00",
    "description": "",
    "direction": "INGRESS",
    "disabled": false,
    "enableLogging": false,
    "id": "1942049412573862976",
    "kind": "compute#firewall",
    "logConfig": {
      "enable": false
    },
    "name": "allow-inbound-traffic",
    "network": "projects/idyllic-parser-310104/global/networks/default",
    "priority": 1000,
    "selfLink": "projects/idyllic-parser-310104/global/firewalls/allow-inbound-traffic",
    "sourceRanges": [
      "10.128.0.2",
      "10.128.0.3",
      "34.69.212.61",
      "34.69.134.109"
    ]
  }
